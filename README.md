# HM-10 Arduino Library
## Hello with HM-10 Module
The Bluetooth 4.0 module is developed and distribute by http://www.jnhuamao.cn. It's controlled by serial connection with AT command. To make it easy for using with Arduino, we created this project to expose as the API library. Besides that, we also make it easily for customizing and extending. Hope it will be useful for you.

I post some quick start to use this library. Any questions or comments, please contact through email: ledongthuc@gmail.com ( I'm not Chinese, please don't test me with their language :) )

## Quick Tutorial
1. Hardware, connect together
2. Quick start with Test Command
3. Query and change BAUD's Rate connection between Arduino and HM-10 module
